## Orchard

Orchard is a 2D game where you catch apples falling from trees in your orchard. 
See how many you can catch before you spoil this season's harvest. You can't actually lose, though, so knock yourself out.

I made this small game to learn more about game programming and SFML. Aside from lower level hardware interaction, this game was made from scratch.
